# MNIST-data-Analysis
##Introduction
A repo for handling MNIST data with several ML models(or several frameworks).

I aim to write several ML models(or same model using different frameworks) for recognizing handwritten digits taken from MNIST dataset.
I will be focussing on the following models.
* Linear SVM model.
* Basic Neural Nets model using Tensorflow.
* Deep Neural Nets(multilayer convolutional network) Model using Tensorflow.
